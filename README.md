2. It brings you to the "menu screen", where you can choose to start the game with the selected map or quit game which close the entire game window.

### Play the game
1. The main character can move up, down, left, right, you can control it with the direction keys on the key board.You can't walk through walls.
2. The game starts with 3 lives. To get out of the maze you need to collect one or more keys (the information is provided at HUD which is on the top center of the game screen).
3. You win the game if you are able to collect the sufficient amount of keys and get out of the maze from the exit; you loose the game if you lost all the lives during the game.
4. There are 2 kinds of obstacles that reduces your life, one is the moving animies which detects your location and goes after you, another one is the blue traps which you need to avoid.
5. To increase your life you can walk to the red spinning heart, and your life will increase by 1. The status of your lives and collection of keys is showed at the game HUD.

## Additional Game Mechanics
